# GifTastic
This app uses an AJAX call with Javascript to query the Gif API for gif's that relate to either set emotions all ready in place or user can add emotions to search as well. The rating is set to PG-13 or lower so gifs are appropiate for users. The user can click on the gifs to either pause it or start the gif.

# To Get Started
Press one of the green buttons of different emotions or type in an emotion to create a new button at the top then click the button to see all gifs related to that emotion. Then once the gifs are loaded then click on the gif of choose to see the gif in action and then click agian to freeze. Click the refresh button for the browser to start from the beginning. 

Built with: HTML, CSS, Javascript, AJAX, and the gif API key.
